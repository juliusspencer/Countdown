Countdown
=========

This is simply a hacked together project (in a minimum amount of time) for Android which shows a countdown timer and loads an image. In 
addition, long pressing on the time toggles playing a beep sound and long pressing anywhere else presents a fragment for 
selecting the event date / time and image URL. When the countdown completes an image is loaded from the URL.
